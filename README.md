# Virtual Keyboard 
A Virtual Keyboard is made using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

It is an on-screen input mechanism that works in the same way as a conventional keyboard to fill in input fields. In the absence of a physical keyboard, it is a valuable tool for typing text using the mouse or another pointing device.

## Features

+ Automatically detects input and textarea elements within the user's project and configures them to function with the virtual keyboard.
+ Automatically injects the keyboard's markup with one line of HTML
+ Full QWERTY keyboard with support for shift, caps lock, enter (return), and backspace
+ Submit button will submit entered text and clear the input area.

## How To Implement:

First, add the scripts and css folders contained within this repository to your project.

<br>In the `<head>` of your document, add the following element:<br>
  `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/keyboard.css">`
  
<br>At the bottom of your ```<body>``` element, add the following lines:<br>
  <br>`<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/keyboard-handler.js"></script>`
  <br>*Please note that you may have to change the file paths within the script tags' src attributes.*
